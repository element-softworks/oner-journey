# Image Assets

This directory should contain the following image assets:

1. `attractor-poster.jpg` - The poster image shown while the landing video loads
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080
   - Format: JPG
   - Should be a representative frame from the attractor video

2. Icons for PWA usage are stored in the `/icons` directory.

For testing, you'll need to source appropriate retail-themed images or create placeholders.
